# Technician Inventory Ledger (PoC)

A Django-based **proof of concept** for managing technician parts inventory using an **audit-first, ledger-driven design**.

This project demonstrates how to model, track, and audit inventory movements (receive, issue, transfer, adjust) across warehouses and technician locations in a way that is **safe, traceable, and enterprise-ready**.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**
> This repository is a **generic, non-production PoC**. It contains no proprietary data, credentials, internal URLs, or company-specific integrations. Names, workflows, and data models are intentionally generalized.

## 🚀 Why This Project Exists

Most inventory systems store *current counts* and treat history as an afterthought. That approach makes audits, investigations, and error recovery difficult.

This PoC flips that model:

* Inventory is derived from an **append-only ledger**
* Every movement is attributable to a user, time, and reason
* Corrections are recorded as new events, not silent edits

This pattern mirrors real-world best practices used in:

* enterprise asset tracking
* financial systems
* security-sensitive environments

## ✨ Key Features

* **Parts Catalog**

  * Unique part numbers
  * Units of measure
  * Active/inactive lifecycle

* **Locations**

  * Warehouse
  * Technician
  * Extensible for future location types

* **Inventory Ledger (Core Concept)**

  * RECEIVE / ISSUE / TRANSFER / ADJUST actions
  * Immutable, append-only history
  * Inline line items per transaction

* **Audit-Friendly by Design**

  * Who did what
  * When it happened
  * Where inventory moved
  * Why it changed (reference + notes)

* **Admin-Driven PoC UI**

  * Rapid prototyping via Django Admin
  * Clean separation of apps and responsibilities

### Design Principles

* **Ledger-first** (history is source of truth)
* **Explicit state changes** (no hidden mutations)
* **Separation of concerns** (catalog vs movement)
* **Enterprise-safe PoC** (upgrade path in mind)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Python 3.12**
* **Django**
* **SQLite** (local PoC only)
* **Django Admin** (rapid UI + validation)

Planned upgrades:

* PostgreSQL
* Django REST Framework
* Dockerized deployment

## 📊 What This PoC Demonstrates

* Real-world Django project structure
* Correct use of migrations and admin configuration
* Inventory modeled as **events**, not counters
* Clean Git hygiene and documentation
* Safe external publication of an internal-style system

This project is intentionally scoped to show **systems thinking**, not just CRUD screens.

---

## 🧭 Roadmap

Planned next steps:

* On-hand inventory views (derived from ledger)
* Low-stock alerts
* Technician request & approval workflow
* Role-based access control (RBAC)
* REST API layer
* Dockerized PoC deployment
